### Technologies and Concepts Used

This project leverages various technologies and concepts to achieve its functionality. Here's an overview of the key ones:

#### Standalone Components

The project is built using standalone components, each designed to handle a specific task or functionality. These components are self-contained and can be easily reused across the application. This approach promotes modularity, making it easier to maintain and update individual components without affecting the entire application.

#### Cross-Component Outputs

To facilitate communication between components, the project employs cross-component outputs. This allows components to share data and events with each other, enabling a more dynamic and interactive user experience. Outputs are used to emit events or data from one component to another, enabling a loose coupling between components and promoting a more modular architecture.

#### Outputs and @Inputs Decorator

The project utilizes the `@Inputs` decorator to define properties that can be passed from a parent component to a child component. This decorator is used to mark a property as an input, allowing the parent component to bind a value to it. This approach enables a clear and explicit way of passing data between components, making it easier to understand and manage the data flow within the application.

Additionally, the project uses outputs to emit events or data from a child component to its parent component. This is achieved through the use of the `@Outputs` decorator, which marks a property as an output. This allows the child component to notify the parent component of changes or events, enabling a more dynamic and interactive user interface.

By leveraging these technologies and concepts, the project achieves a modular, scalable, and maintainable architecture that is easy to understand and extend.
